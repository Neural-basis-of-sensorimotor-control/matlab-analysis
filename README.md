Waveform detection tool: 
==========================

In general terms, this is a program for postprocesing analysis of recorded data in one or several analog or digital channels. 
More specifically, it has been customized to our needs (data recorded in Spike2 from electrophysiological experiments). It can be modified to be used for other purposes. 

The program has a graphical user interface so it does not require knowledge of Matlab. Start by typing sc -help in the command prompt.
