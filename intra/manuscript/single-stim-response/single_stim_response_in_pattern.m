% Generate binomial distribution for each neuron

% Generate binomial distribution for null hypothesis, with response
% probability for each neuron given by least squares fit with recorded data

% Make PCA plot for a) all neurons together, and b) neuron vs each control
% (if relevant)

% Compute P value for each neuron and pattern, with null hypothesis given
% by statistical model with constant response probability
